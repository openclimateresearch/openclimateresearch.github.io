        <h1>Open Climate Research Collective</h1>
        <p class="major">Providing the last push to move climate change research off of laptops and into the scientific record. 
</p>
        <p>Open Climate Research Collective (<strong>OCRC</strong>) is a non-profit (501(C)(3) status pending) supporting non-traditional scientists and researchers. The climate crisis we all face can only be addressed collectively and openly across disciplines and countries. No piece of knowledge is too small to neglect. We believe that overly-competitive funding and personal circumstance should not be a limit to climate crisis mitigation.

        <h2>Contribute science</h2>
        <p>Do you have unfunded and unpublished scientific results that are relevant to the future of our planet in a changing climate? Are you a researcher who doesn't fit easily into the university system? Do personal circumstances limit your ability to move up in the highly competitive academic world? Are you caring for a child or family member? Are you managing social anxiety, ADD/ADHD, or another mental health condition? Do you come from an underrepresented background? Are you on the Autism Spectrum? While countless factors might keep you from landing a competitive academic position, we think your novel scientific knowledge is valuable. We want to remove the barriers of your career achievements and help add your research to the scientific record.

    <h3>The climate crisis</h3>
    <p>Open source Earth and climate research often has no direct market value and is therefore left to goverments to fund. Yet the pressing mitigation of the climate crisis has no tolerance  for political cycles and dimishing and uncertain funding. Becasue of this factor, ORCR has a specific focus on advancing Earth and climate science.</p>

                <section>
    <span class="icon solid style2 major fa-chart-bar"></span>
    <h3>The scientists</h3>
    <p>OCRC will provide funding to individuals who have existing unpublished climate related scientific knoledge, yet don&#39;t easily fit into the traditional academic setting. We do not believe in the academic hierarchy and will fund any individual with a novel discovery from from a high schooler to a citizen scientist to retired university faculty.</p>
</section>

            
                <section>
    <span class="icon solid style2 major fa-sync-alt"></span>
    <h3>Diversity in science</h3>
    <p>We want the academic landscape of the next generation to be more diverse than it is today. Recipients of OCRC funds will be matched with an undergraduate from an underrepresented background to share, remotely using VR, what exactly a climate / Earth scientist does and break down any stigma that science is not a viable field for them to enter.</p>
</section>

            
                <section>
    <span class="icon solid style2 major fa-save"></span>
    <h3>Open source / open access</h3>
    <p>We are intollerant to barriers that prevent the advancemnt of a collective knoledge. All research conducted with OCRC funding must be made open source in annotated Jupyter notebooks and research articles must be submiteed to open access journals. </p>
</section>

            
                <section>
    <span class="icon solid style2 major fa-cog"></span>
    <h3>Millennial led organization</h3>
    <p>The individuals who generally oversee scientific funding are seasoned academics. While we deeply respect the wisdom a long career in science afforts, we would like to try something new. We are a 100% millenial run and operated organization. We beleve a young board of directors has even more at stake with respect to creating a more equitable and sustainable human existence on Earth.</p>

                <section>
    <span class="icon style2 major fa-gem"></span>
    <h3>The outcome</h3>
    <p>A community of donors, researchers and a more diverse next generation of researchers all with an interest in improving our stewardship of Planet Earth. OCRC will help widen the cannon of scientific literature that is, and will continue, to form the basis for our mitigation of the climate crisis. The faster we can understand and model the nuances of our Earth system, the better prepared we will be to protect the future.</p>

                                        <p>All Earth scientists have a mountain of data, results and half finished projects sitting on their laptops. It is not out of mal-intent that this information is hoarded and often lost, but rather the final step of producing a “complete” story for a peer reviewed publication is intensive and time consuming. While scientific publishing is the primary means of communicating findings, the academic stages beyond a doctoral degree are focused on self preservation through grant writing and appeasing the demands of a host institution. <br><br> 

There is a pyramid of availability of positions within academia. Undergraduate is widely available. Narrowing from Master’s, PhD, postdoc and faculty positions, the availability and competitive nature of the positions increase. With the increase in competition there is also an  increase in the number of competitive applicants that were ultimately rejected. Uniquely, starting around the Masters/PhD level and continuing above, these rejected applicants carry a valuable and underutilized commodity: unpublished knowledge.<br><br> 

For individuals between the higher academic ranks or interested in finishing started projects but preferring to operate outside of the academic structure, we offer medium sized grants to complete and publish their findings. We will preference climate and arctic related research that predicts the state of our planet into the future. We will require all grant recipients to publish in open source journals as well as make all code publicly available and well annotated with working examples. We will encourage our recipients to publishes what journals often call “letters” or shorter publications which can be written and reviewed in a more expedient fashion and will help destigmatize these shorter publications as “not as good as” more comprehensive, narrative style science articles. Finally we will require our recipients to initiate and maintain for one year an undergraduate mentorship program targeted to underprivileged and underrepresented groups in an effort to demonstrate the accessibility of STEM fields to people of any background.

The glacier ruoff flows from the cryosphere to the ocean(s). Earths oceans are likely the most critical component in the climate-Earth system and the most likely to cause mass devistation to us and our infrastructure. Above is the Earth observing satellite, Landsat 9, which was launched on 27 September 2021 and will provide freely available imagery to scientists around the globe. Finally, we find the partial derivative (read as the letters d t d t) expressing the change in temperature (T) with respect to time (t) to be eloquent both in its formulation but also in how it contains the conceptual entirety of the climate crisis in a single term.   </p>

His ability to contribute to science is evident in his publications, yet his temperament does not fit well into a traditional academic setting. After putting $2,000 of publication fees for a journal article on his personal credit card, he realized the most good he could do for climate research is to reduce this burden for other self-motivated/independent researchers. In short, he would like to heighten the value and acknowledgment of scientific contributions while bringing open-source information to the scientific community and public.</p>
